The run_analysis.R script does the following operations in order:

- Reads in the Training and Test datasets;
- Stacks the two datasets;
- Extract the columns containing either "mean()" or "std()" in their name;
- Adds a column to the dataset describing the activity each row corresponds to;
- Changes the column names;
- Adds a column with the identifier of the subject that produced each measurement;
- Groups the resulting dataset by "Activity" and "Subject" number;
- Computes the mean for each group;
- Writes the resulting dataset in a .txt. file;

The script itself contains comments line-by-line.
